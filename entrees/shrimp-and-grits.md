# Shrimp and Grits

## Ingredients
* 2 c chicken broth
* 2 c milk
* 8 tbsp butter
* 1 c grits
* 1 c sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
* 8 slices bacon
* 1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
* 4 cloved garlic, minced
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced, whites and stems divided
* creole seasoning
* salt and pepper to taste
* 1/2 c cognac

## Directions
1. Set the oven to 400Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. When the oven reaches temperature, lay the bacon out and put on the middle rack for 18-20 minutes, or until the bacon is appropriately crispy.
2. In a medium saucepan, bring chicken broth, milk, and 3 tbsp butter to a boil and season generously with salt. Reduce to a simmer then whisk in grits. Simmer, stirring often, until grits have absorbed liquid and are very tender. Stir in cheese, and an additional 3 tbsp butter, then season with salt and pepper.
3. Pour bacon grease into a large skillet and start it on medium-high. Add the shrimp, green onions, and garlic. Toss often, and when the shrimp is almost cooked through, add the cognac to the skillet and light it to burn the alcohol off. Add remaining two tbsp of butter and stir to emulsify your sauce.
4. Serve shrimp and sauce over grits. Top with chopped bacon and green onion stem slices.
