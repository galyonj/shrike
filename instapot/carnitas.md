## Carnitas Ingredients
* 1 (4-5lb) boneless pork shoulder, cut into two-inch cubes (trim excess fat)
* fine sea salt
* black pepper
* Corn oil (peanut or canola oil will suffice)
* 1 batch [mojo sauce](#mojo-sauce-ingredients) (see recipe below)
* for serving: fresh cilantro, diced red or white onion, and/or fresh salsa or pico de gallo

## Mojo Sauce Ingredients
* 1 cup beer (preferably a bock or a dark lager)
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup fresh orange juice
* 1/4 cup fresh lime juice
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper

## Carnitas Instructions
* In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the mojo sauce ingredients until combined.  Set aside until ready to use.
* Season the pork chunks with salt and pepper
* Sear off the pork chunks. You can do this in the instapot using the `Saute` function, but take particular care to scrape the stuck on bits off the instapot, or you'll have to deal with clearing burn warnings, and your cook time will be *greatly extended*. I just do this step stovetop and transfer the meat over to the instapot. But you do you, boo.
* Add the meat and the mojo sauce to the instapot, stir to combine
* Close the lid and ensure the vent is set to `Sealing`
* Press the `Pressure Cook` button and set the timer to 15 minutes
* When the timer goes off, allow the instapot to vent naturally for an additional 15 minutes.
* Set the oven broiler to `High`.
* Remove the lid of the Instapot, scoop the meat onto a sheet pan, and shred the meat. Spoon about 1/3 of the juice in the instapot onto the meat, and toss to combine.
* Broil until the edges are mahogany and crispy
* Remove from broiler, add juices, and toss to expose unbrowned meat, then return to broiler.
* You can repeat the last step as often as you feel is necessary
* Eat
